00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,100
Hi welcome to unit 10 so unit 10 is all about Javascript functions.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,230
Another one those really important components that we're going to use for the rest of the course.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,730
And not only is it one of the most important.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,520
I'd argue it's the most important part of Javascript.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,290
So pretty much anyone who's ever worked with javascript anyone who has any experience with it would

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,790
tell you that the one thing that you have to know in order to understand and to work with javascript

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,620
well is functions.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,050
Functions are the building blocks of everything and javascript or almost everything.

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,320
So this unit focuses solely on functions.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,260
But we're going to get a lot of practice in every exercise every assignment we do from here on out when

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,130
we get to know JSM we get J Query.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,830
It's all based around functions.

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,880
So lots and lots of practice coming up later in this lesson.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,080
And later in the course.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,610
So we have three main objectives in this unit.

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,430
First is for you to write function declarations and function expressions and don't worry I'll explain

17
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,110
in quite a bit of detail what those are and how they're similar and how they're different.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,620
So two ways of writing functions I want you you'd be able to write both of them the next objective is

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,990
a little bit more bite size.

20
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,130
I'd like for you to be able to explain the difference between conses not logging something and returning

21
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:08,710
something.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,740
So return is a special word it is a key word in javascript that does something special that you'll see

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,590
in the next unit.

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,530
So the last objective is that I'd like you to be able to define your own functions whether there are

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,140
function declarations or function expressions own defined functions that can take multiple arguments

26
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,330
and then will wrap up this unit with some more advanced discussions about two topics which are scope

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,080
and higher order functions.

28
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,230
So I don't have the objectives for those because they're not technically core to everything we're talking

29
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,920
about they're not central concepts that you absolutely have to understand.

30
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,480
Really I'm trying to make those make the objectives of the foundational the fundamental things that

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,470
you have to know before you leave this course.

32
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,460
But scope and higher order functions are two topics that are important.

33
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,670
They're intrinsic to J.S..

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,800
I mean talk about them at length in the last two videos in this unit.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,060
So look forward to that or don't skip them if you want.

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,420
OK I'll see in the next.
