<h4>Hi Everyone,<br></h4><p>In the next lecture Colt will explain the difference between a Function Declaration and a Function Expression.</p><p>There has been some confusion reported in the Q&amp;A over whether or not you can overwrite both types of functions.</p><p>The answer is yes, no matter how you name a function, be it with a variable in a function expression or directly in a function declaration, it can be overwritten if you assign that same variable to something else, later in your code.</p><p>If you want some further reading on the differences between the two, IÂ recommend reading <a href="https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this article</a> after watching the next video lecture.</p><p>--------<br>Thanks,<br>Ian</p>
