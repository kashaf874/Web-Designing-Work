00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,660
Hi welcome to unit 9.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:07,980
So this is the second unit focusing only on javascript no edged him out no CSSA just yet we have this

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,300
unit which talks about control flow.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,570
We just learned about the basics of javascript's of primitives variables.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,740
Some of the basic built in methods and we also talked about how we run files and how to use the chrome

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,530
developer cons. And this unit we're talking about control flow which is really about making decisions

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,980
and controlling the way that our code runs.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,950
So we're going to talk about some really important concepts including IF statements or conditionals

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,180
and loops.

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,720
And before I dive into these specific objectives I just want to give you a lay for land.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,810
We have three more units after this one.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,350
So four more basic gyroscope units in total before we go back to each timeout and see assess.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,500
And then we add in javascript together and we talked about something called Dom and inflation.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,170
So once we do that we can start making some fun games.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,850
We can start really building applications things that are interactive and that look really nice and

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:03,740
are styled well not just simple console games or javascript basic games but really substantial applications

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,410
so we're getting there but I don't need to skip ahead to that.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,830
It might be tempting but trust me it's really important that you understand everything that we're going

19
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,470
to talk about in the next few minutes.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,030
These are probably the most important for the rest of the course.

21
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,460
You might think that they're the most boring or the least exciting reasons for not making something

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,040
there's no exciting finished product there's no real payoff.

23
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,270
But if promise if you just wait a few units you'll make it through this section which hopefully is exciting

24
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,930
enough.

25
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,270
We talk about how programming languages work.

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,770
We talk about writing logic it's really a creative endeavor in my opinion it's not something that's

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,910
as dry or intimidating as it might appear at first.

28
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,420
But the point is that what we're going to learn here is foundational for everything else for no Jay

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,490
asked for Express for Jay Querrey for Dominey relation for databases authentication everything that

30
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,260
we're going to talk about in this unit and the next three units is going to carry over to every other

31
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,750
topic in this course that involves Javascript.

32
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,960
So hang in there we'll get to making those games really really soon.

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,180
As far as this particular unit is concerned we have four main objectives and they really revolve around

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,280
two main categories and two main topics which as I mentioned earlier are conditional statements and

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,900
loops.

36
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,310
The first objective is that by the end of this unit I want you to be able to evaluate complex logical

37
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,160
statements.

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,460
So you'll be using things like boolean operators and logical operators and comparison operators.

39
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,410
Basically I want you to understand how they work and how they interact and that's closely related to

40
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:31,230
the next objective which is that I want you to be able to write conditional statements with if else

41
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,870
if and else components.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,220
So three part conditional statements which is how we make decisions in javascript and then the next

43
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,250
two objectives pertain to loops.

44
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,000
So the first one is pretty simple.

45
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,770
I just want you to be able to write for loops and while loops and incorporate them into your own applications

46
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,450
and your own exercises.

47
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,980
So two types of loops for loops and while loops and then the last objective is that I'd like you to

48
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,520
be able to translate from one type to another.

49
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,400
So from a for loop to a while loop or take an existing while loop and turn it into a for loop.

50
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,580
And then of course sprinkled throughout the unit there are a few exercises small projects and Equus
