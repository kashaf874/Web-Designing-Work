<p>Hi Everyone!</p>

<p>In the next lecture Colt has a couple of examples that use an empty string, or two quotes with nothing between them: <code>""</code>. However, the slides make it look like there might be a space between the quotes (which would not be an empty string). You'll see why this distinction is important as you view the video, but for now just remember that if you see two quotes: <code>""</code>, that it is in fact an empty string.</p>
