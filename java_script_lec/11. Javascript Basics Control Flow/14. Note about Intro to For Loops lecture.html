<p>Hi <strong>Everyone</strong>!<br><br>In the following lecture "Intro to For Loops" there is a typo in the slides around the 56 second mark. It should say <strong>count = 1</strong> instead of <strong>count = 0</strong>, since the loopÂ is supposed to go from 1 - 5, not 0 - 5.<br><br>Thanks!<br>Ian<br><em>Course TA</em></p>
