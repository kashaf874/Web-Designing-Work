<p>Hi <strong>E</strong><strong>veryone</strong>!<br>In the next lecture there is a typo in the slides at 8 minutes and 9 seconds, the slides should&nbsp;say that an infinite loop occurs when the terminating condition&nbsp;<em>never returns </em><strong><em>false</em></strong><em>.</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>be warned</strong> that if you write an infinite loop and run it, it could&nbsp;crash your browser and possibly&nbsp;even your computer. Please watch the videos all the way through and don't execute or run any code prior to watching Colt do it. If you do happen to run an infinite loop then you'll need to force quit the browser application as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>Ian<br>Course TA</p>
