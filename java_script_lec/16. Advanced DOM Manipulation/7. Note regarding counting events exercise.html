<p>Hello&nbsp;<strong>Everyone</strong>!<br><br>The MDN page from the following lecture (Counting Events Exercise) has changed since&nbsp;we created this video. You may follow along in the video and use the same commands that Colt uses, but do not expect to get the same result (<strong>301 events</strong>).&nbsp;The format of the page is different now and&nbsp;there are some duplicates. The important lesson here is the use of <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code>&nbsp; and other such document methods, the actual number of events on the page is trivial.</p>

<p><br>Thanks!<br>Ian<br><em>Course TA</em></p>
