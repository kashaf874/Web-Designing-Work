<p>Hi <strong>Everyone</strong>!</p>

<p>Around 14 minutes and 45 seconds into the next lecture, Colt says: "we're going to take this numInput.value and turn it into a String".</p>

<p>He should have said "..and turn it into a Number". Small mixup there, so I just wanted to make this note in case anyone got confused.</p><p>Meanwhile, some students have been asking about the difference between the <strong>input</strong> and <strong>change</strong> event listeners, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17047607/3176573" rel="nofollow">here's</a> a good explanation of both - https://stackoverflow.com/a/17047607/3176573</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>Ian<br><em>Course TA</em></p>
