<p>Hi <strong>Everyone</strong>!<br><br>While you're following along in the next lecture, you may notice that your Chrome console output looks slightly different than Colt's. This is because he was using an older version of Chrome when these lectures were made.</p><p>Your code isn't broken, it just looks a little different. All of the DOM syntax (selector methods, etc.) will remain the same.<br><br>You can read more about this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/questions/2104314" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> - https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/questions/2104314</p><p>Meanwhile, in the following lecture about "Important Selector Methods", Colt mistakenly refers to the array-like object that comes back from document.getElementsByClassName() as a "<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NodeList</a>", when in fact it is an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCollection" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HTMLCollection</a>. While they are similar, there are some differences between them. You can learn more about those differences, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/15763707" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Ian<br><em>Course TA</em></p>
