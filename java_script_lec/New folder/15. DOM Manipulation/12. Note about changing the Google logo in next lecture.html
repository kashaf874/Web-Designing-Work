<p>Hi <strong>Everyone</strong>!<br><br>In the following lecture, <strong>Playing With Google Code Along</strong>, you'll be changing the logo on the google website using the <strong>src</strong> attribute. However, this method no longer works. Instead, use the <strong>srcset</strong> attribute to change the logo image.</p>

<p>If you are having difficulty, you can read more about how to do this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/questions/1400558" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>







<p>Additionally, if you're visiting google.com and getting redirected to your country's version of google, then try visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/ncr" rel="nofollow">this link</a> instead. - https://www.google.com/ncr</p>







<p>Lastly, if you'd rather be able to follow along directly with the lecture then please use <a href="https://codepen.io/nax3t/full/oWNpXZ/" rel="nofollow">this example website</a>* that I created, instead of google.com. <em>*Note - you will need to first inspect the logo by right clicking on it and selecting <strong>Inspect Element</strong> then run the JS code in the console<br></em><br>--------<br>Cheers,<br>Ian <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqo2YWBtmFSWhuUk4WEyfGg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
