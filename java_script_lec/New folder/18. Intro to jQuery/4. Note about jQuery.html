<p>Hi Everyone!</p>

<p>In the next few lectures, as you're learning about jQuery, Colt's output in the console will look a little bit different than yours. From what I&nbsp;can tell this is due to updates in the chrome browser.</p>



<p>Your output will look different because chrome is showing you the jQuery object, not the element that you selected. In order to view the element you must access it via <code>$('div')[0];</code>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can read more about this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13552432/show-elements-when-logging-jquery-object-in-chrome-dev-tools-console/13567689#13567689"  rel="nofollow">here</a>, including how to iterate over a collection of elements and log them to the console.</p><p>Additionally,&nbsp;please be sure to use the .min version of jQuery in your projects, <strong><em></em><em></em><em>not the .slim version&nbsp;</em></strong>as it doesn't include all of jQuery's features which are necessary for upcoming exercises/lectures.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>Ian</p>
