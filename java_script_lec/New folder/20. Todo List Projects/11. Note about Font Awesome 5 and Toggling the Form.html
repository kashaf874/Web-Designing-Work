<p>Hi All,</p>

<p>In the next lecture you'll be learning how to toggle the form for your todo list. If you're using the latest version of Font Awesome (5 or greater)&nbsp;for the plus icon, then you'll have trouble getting the code in that video to work correctly.</p>







<p>Font Awesome 5 converts the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>&nbsp;element into an SVG. To work around this we have to wrap the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>&nbsp;element in a span and select the span in our JS with an id. This also means we have to style the todo list trash can&nbsp;spans with <code>li span</code>&nbsp;in our CSS, instead of just using <code>span</code>, which would mess up our toggle button.</p><p>I've attached the updated solution for Font Awesome 5 (along with the original solution) in the next lecture's resources.</p><p>-------<br>Thanks,<br>Ian - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqo2YWBtmFSWhuUk4WEyfGg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Learn more</a></p>
